# Reflection
I have some experience with coding in Java so I found this assignment easy however I had not used markdown files before and so learning how to use markdown files was interesting. I also had never used PlantUML to create UML diagrams and so that was something I had to get used to. I appreciate learning these new methods to help my java code be understood better.
